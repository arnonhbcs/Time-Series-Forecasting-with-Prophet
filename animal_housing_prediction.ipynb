    "# Time Series Forecasting with Prophet\n",

    "In this project, we will use the **Prophet** framework to predict outcomes for domestic animals at the Austin Animal Housing.\n",

    "## Prophet and Time Series\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series forecasting can be challenging, as it often involves complex statistical models. This makes it a difficult task for ML engineers, statisticians, and economists alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify forecasting tasks, Meta developed **Prophet**â€”a framework capable of generating automated predictions in a relatively short runtime. It was originally created to address Facebook's internal forecasting needs and tends to work well on data that meets the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data collected over long periods of time  \n",
    "- Strong, clearly visible seasonal patterns  \n",
    "- Known holidays or special dates  \n",
    "- Nonlinear trends that approach a limit\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Prophet Model for Time Series\n",
    "\n",
    "Prophet decomposes time series data into three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + \\varepsilon_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- $g(t)$ (Trend): Models non-periodic changes in the time series.  \n",
    "- $s(t)$ (Seasonality): Captures recurring patterns or cycles in the data.  \n",
    "- $h(t)$ (Holidays): Accounts for the effects of holidays and special events.  \n",
    "- $\\varepsilon_t$ (Error): Represents residual noise, typically assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution."
